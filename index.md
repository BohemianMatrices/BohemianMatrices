Welcome to the __Bohemian matrices__ homepage. Our website is still cooking but in the mean time you should check out our <a href="{{ '/gallery' | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}">awesome gallery</a> of Bohemian eigenvalue plots!

## What are Bohemian Matrices?
A family of __Bohemian matrices__ is a distribution of random matrices where the matrix entries are sampled from a discrete set of bounded height. The discrete set must be independent of the dimension of the matrices.

## What are Bohemian Eigenvalues?
__Bohemian eigenvalues__ are the eigenvalues of a family of Bohemian matrices.

## The Characteristic Polynomial Database (CPDB)
The [__Characteristic Polynomial Database__](CPDB) contains the sets of characteristic polynomials of several families of Bohemian matrices. Many properties of these families are archived in the characteristic polynomial database. Currently the database stores __1,762,728,075__ characteristic polynomials from __2,366,960,967,336__ matrices.

## Why "Bohemian"?
When this project was in its early stages, our focus was on random integer matrices of bounded height. We originally used the phrase "bounded height integer matrix eigenvalues" to refer to our work. This led to the acronym BHIME which isn't to far off from "Bohemian".
